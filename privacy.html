  <h1>NextFlow â€” Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta">Last updated: <strong>October 16, 2025</strong></p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>NextFlow is a browser extension that automates navigation between YouTube Shorts and provides configurable ad-handling behavior. We built NextFlow to run entirely in your browser. This policy explains what data (if any) the extension collects, how it is stored and used, and how you can control or delete it.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p><strong>Short answer:</strong> NextFlow does <em>not</em> collect or transmit your personal browsing history or watch data to any external server by default.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Settings:</strong> User preferences (autoScroll, skipAds, delayMs, and other UI preferences) are stored locally in your browser using Chrome's <code>chrome.storage</code> API. These settings are not shared externally.</li>
    <li><strong>No analytics by default:</strong> There is no telemetry or analytics sent to external services by default. If a future opt-in telemetry feature is added, it will be clearly labeled and require explicit user consent.</li>
    <li><strong>No PII collection:</strong> The extension does not collect personally identifiable information (PII) such as emails, names, or account identifiers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>In-page actions</h2>
  <p>NextFlow interacts with the YouTube page DOM to perform actions like clicking a "Skip ad" button (only when you opt-in). These actions happen entirely in your browser and do not create a copy of your watch history or send it elsewhere.</p>

  <h2>Third-party services</h2>
  <p>NextFlow does not use third-party analytics or cloud services by default. Any future integrations requiring network access will be optional and clearly described.</p>

  <h2>Storage & Retention</h2>
  <p>Settings are stored in Chrome's storage (local or sync). You can export settings via the Options page and delete them by resetting the extension settings. Uninstalling the extension removes its local data stored by Chrome.</p>

  <h2>Your choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Disable auto actions from the popup at any time.</li>
    <li>Use the Options page to export, import, or reset your settings.</li>
    <li>Uninstall the extension to remove stored settings and data from your browser.</li>
  </ul>
